            <li><em>Expected Result</em>: What should happen if everything is okay, like &quot;The bed should feel soft and cozy.&quot;</li>
            <li><em>Actual Result</em>: What actually happened during the test.</li>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li><strong>Selenium:</strong> Indy and Grey learn that Selenium is a tool that lets them control a web browser automatically. It&apos;s like getting a robot to do their clicking and typing for them.</li>
                <li><strong>Gherkin:</strong> Gherkin is a way to write down what they want the robot to do in plain language. It&rsquo;s like giving the robot a to-do list.</li>
                <li><strong>Why Learn This:</strong> Just like how Indy and Grey can train themselves to do the same things every day, they can train a robot to handle routine testing tasks, freeing up time for more important work.</li>

            <p><strong>Tool Exploration with Robot Framework:</strong></p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Indy and Grey decide to explore the Robot Framework, which uses Selenium to automate web testing.</li>
                <li><strong>Robot Framework:</strong> It&rsquo;s a tool that helps them write test cases in a simple, human-readable language, making it easier to automate tests.</li>
                <li><strong>Installation:</strong> They install Robot Framework on their computer, along with the necessary libraries to start automating tasks in a web browser.</li>
                <li><strong>Example Task:</strong>Indy and Grey create a simple script to automate checking if their favorite cat toy website is up and running.<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                        <li>*** Settings *** Library &nbsp; &nbsp;SeleniumLibrary *** Test Cases *** Check Cat Toy Website &nbsp; &nbsp;Open Browser &nbsp; &nbsp;https://www.cat-toys.com &nbsp; &nbsp;chrome &nbsp; &nbsp;Title Should Be &nbsp; &nbsp;Cat Toys - Home of the Best Cat Toys &nbsp; &nbsp;Close Browser</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> This script opens a web browser, goes to the cat toy website, checks the title of the page to make sure they&rsquo;re on the right site, and then closes the browser. It&rsquo;s a simple automation that helps Indy and Grey check the website without having to do it manually.</li>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>Indy and Grey decide to write a slightly more advanced script using the Robot Framework.</li>
                <li><strong>Task:</strong>Automate a login process on the website.<ul class="list-disc list-inside">

                </li>
                <li><strong>Explanation:</strong> In this script, Indy and Grey automate logging into the website. They enter a username and password, click the login button, and check if they successfully land on the user dashboard page. This script saves them time, as they no longer need to log in manually each time they want to check their account.</li>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li><strong>Automation Tools:</strong> Like how a toy can keep a cat entertained for hours without needing human interaction, automation tools like Robot Framework keep the testing process running without Indy and Grey having to do it all manually.</li>
                <li><strong>Scripting:</strong> Writing scripts is like setting up a series of dominoes; once you push the first one, everything follows. Indy and Grey set up the scripts, and the tests run automatically, just like the dominoes falling.</li>
                <li><strong>Robot Framework:</strong> Think of Robot Framework as the cat&rsquo;s toy launcher. It does the work of throwing the toy (running the test) so Indy and Grey can focus on other things.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
